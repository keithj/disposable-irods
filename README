This repository contains scripts to aid in setting up tests that
require a minimal functioning iRODS installation. (Minimal meaning
that the ICAT database server, iRODS server and disk resource all
reside on localhost.) The iRODS server will expect a pre-configured
PostgreSQL server to be available on localhost.

These scripts set up a clean, throwaway iRODS instance suitable for
running basic tests.

Versions of iRODS supported:

   3.3.1 (run-in-place) - Built and installed from git a repository.
>= 4.1.10 (packaged)     - Installed from the official RENCI FTP site.

A version 3.3.1 installation will be in local directory owned by the
current user. WARNING! The installation script supplied with iRODS
3.3.1 will make modifications to that user's $HOME/.odbc.ini. A
version >= 4.1.10 installation will be in the location defined by the
package.

In all cases the current user will have been given an active rodsamin
account, set up for passwordless login to iRODS using iinit.

As some systems may require more than the single default iRODS
resource to be available, an additional resource is added
automatically at install time. These are

   3.3.1 - a resource named 'testResc' with a vault at
           ${IRODS_RIP_DIR}/iRODS/TestVault (see below for the definition
           of 'IRODS_RIP_DIR').

>= 4.1.10 - a resource named 'testResc' with a vault at
           /var/lib/irods/iRODS/TestVault


The scripts supplied are:

./scripts/download_and_verify_irods.sh

    Downloads source or packages as appropriate and makes such
    verification checks as are available.

./scripts/install_irods.sh

    Builds source or installs packages.

./scripts/configure_irods.sh

    Configures an iRODS admin user with a default password for
    testing.


The script behaviour may be modified by setting environment variables.
The most important variable, relevant to both iRODS 3.3.1 and >= 4.1.10
is:

IRODS_VERSION        The iRODS version to install:
                     3.3.1, 4.1.10 (default)


Relevant to 3.3.1 run-in-place install only are:

IRODS_RIP_DIR        A directory to which the run-in-place install will
                     be relocated.


Relevant to >= 4.1.10 packaged install only are:

PG_PLUGIN_VERSION    The iRODS PostgeSQL plugin version to install:
                     1.10 (default)

PLATFORM             The RENCI name for the host platform:
                     ubuntu12 (default)

RENCI_FTP_URL        The RENCI FTP site:
                     ftp://ftp.renci.org (defaults now to https://dnap.cog.sanger.ac.uk)
